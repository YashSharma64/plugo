Where in the world are Plugo's powerbanks.

---

[Plugo](https://plugo.io/) is "India's first smart & fully automated power bank rental service".
They have a mobile app [[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/plugo/id1469215249),
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plugo)] that provides
information about where you can find their powerbanks, but the same is not accessible
on the web. This page hosts republished (and slightly cleaned up) data from the Plugo app
, updated on a regular schedule in an easily accessible and searchable format.
